          Amber Senescent is a short human woman, frustrated with the world and her studies, and ready to throw hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out, living in a tiny, bland flat with nothing but a kichenette, a fold-out bed, a shitty internet
          connection, and a rat, does wonders for your capacity for violence. So, when a ragtag group shows up and Amber
          finds out that the corporation she's been interning for - with the promise of funding her doctorate - is even
          more shady than she'd anticipated...
          <br>She isn't really surprised. But she is driven to deliver retribution...
