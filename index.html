        </h2>
        <p class="text">
          <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> (usually shortened to <em>D&D</em> or <em>DnD</em>) is a game which can be played with none of the usual boardgame set piece necessities. Any group can play with nothing more than some pens and paper and the rules (available <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024" target="_blank" title="Go to D&D Beyond (opens in a new tab)">online</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Someone is the <em>Dungeon Master</em> (<em>DM</em>) and everyone else is a <em>player</em>. The DM sets the scene and tells most of the story, where encounters with friends, foes, and monsters, will happen. Players (and the DMs' characters) create their characters on <em>character sheets</em> (templates for which can be found <a href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/free-rules/ph/character-sheet.pdf" target="_blank" title="Go to D&D Beyond (opens in a new tab)">online</a> or even <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters" target="_blank" title="Go to D&D Beyond (opens in a new tab)">made and kept online</a>). Character sheets for monsters are generally preset (found <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters?srsltid=AfmBOorBGiafgrDCbBLm3VmnMLSZ2u9jL8psvbNwTf4TaBd5X-GqB1KR" target="_blank" title="Go to D&D Beyond (opens in a new tab)">online</a>) but can be improvised by the DM as well, to fit your story better.

          What is Paramore?
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
          <em>Paramore</em> is the world setting for the D&D stories in which we have been playing. Paramore is the name of the continent and of the capitol city. The name of the former capitol city is <em>Metallica</em>, but it was tragically lost in 1,000 A.S. - a story which you will hear about in <em>Band of Bards</em>, which is the next series to be teased and released.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Other places of note are the mining town of <em>Goldvein</em>, the coastal village of <em>Blowfish Bay</em>, the eastern town of <em>Bowie</em> by the <em>Dark Woods</em>, and the <em>Northern Wastes</em> mountain range in the north. The continent has one university in the south, <em>Twilight University</em>, and a vast and unexplored desert which extends south.

                  To start with me, I feel I'm good to play with, <strong>friendly, witty and generally kind</strong>, and have definitely loved my time playing with the rest of the players in the evolving group that has been those who played the several campaigns in Ryan's setting of Paramore.
                </p>
                <p class="text mt-1">
                  Continuing into characters, some of my favourite characters to have played in any game I've been in, both in RP and mechanically, have been the wood elf, Teldrin Rootfoot: a reserved man who, through being mislead and betrayed, became an estranged and presumed dead individual in his home nation, leaving a family behind that he secretly keeps a track on to assure the promises those in power made to him were upheld, would find himself within Paramore, seeking himself in a sense, and finding those who he would come to call his new family.
                </p>
                <p class="text mt-1">
                  The other character of note was Grondle “Limbless” Gervona, a chaotic evil bugbear who happened to have aligning goals with the party, and an amulet of proof against Detection and Location. He was carefree, easy to use violence and brute force to solve all issues before him or the party, and more than willing to steal, kill, or betray those whom he didn't personally care for or wouldn't benefit him. I think my favourite part of playing him was that, due to how he treated the party and his general laissez-faire attitude to things not directly concerning him or his “spirits”, as well as a kindness to nature and animals, no one thought to doubt his motives or ideals until the last session, in which he made contact with and then wore “the talisman of ultimate evil”, which basically atomises anyone who isn't of an evil alignment, and didn't suffer any consequences. <strong>The reaction from the rest of the group was worth the long play</strong>, both in character reactions as well as player reactions to not having even guessed it could be the case over what I think was a 2 year campaign.
                </p>
                <p class="text mt-1">
                  And finally in terms of the setting, it was certainly fun to play in and roam around within, I feel  it ultimately was more like Ryan knew loosely what was in certain places and was throwing rails down in front of the train to keep the groups vaguely headed in a particular direction and hurriedly making specific things when he knew what we'd be doing the next week. The naming scheme was pretty neat, and some of the lore of the world (especially how we as players influenced it as the setting progresses campaign to campaign).
                </p>
                <p class="text mt-1">
                  <strong>Fun times all round!</strong>
